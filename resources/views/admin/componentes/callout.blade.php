<div class="callout callout-success">
                    <h4>Tip!</h4>
          
                    <p>Add the layout-top-nav class to the body tag to get this layout. This feature can also be used with a
                      sidebar! So use this class if you want to remove the custom dropdown menus from the navbar and use regular
                      links instead.</p>
